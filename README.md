# PGL_Booklah - Team 3

Overview: A Restaurant seat/table reservation based on the booking size and restaurant availability. This system will be able to follow the Government's COVID-19 restriction measures.

Reasons for doing this project: 

With the constant changes to Government policy due to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
Restaurants are affected by the number of seatings they are able to provide.
Patrons are not sure which restaurants are able to accommodate them when they were to head direct down to the restaurants.
Restaurants are often frowned upon when they have crowd outside and they are not able to manage the safe distancing measures outside of their premises.
Extra manpower need to be allocated for the restaurants to manage situation outside to avoid any run in with the law(fines).

How can this project solve these issues?

Patrons can avoid making their way down to the restaurant without knowing if there is space for them thus avoiding crowding and the need for social distancing to be managed there. Eliminate queues and patrons waiting time.
A booking system that is adaptable to Government changes in safe distancing measures (crowd limits, gathering limits, dine in limits).
The system will help to maintain crowd numbers inside the restaurant.
Allow patrons to locate available and suitable restaurants to dine in based on seats availability and time allocations. Restaurants will have control to release seats for no show or late turn up.
Help to maximize profitability for restaurants as they are now available as an option to patrons who have intent to dine in.
